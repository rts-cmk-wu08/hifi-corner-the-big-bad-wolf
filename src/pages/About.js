                <b><h5>History</h5></b>
                <b><p class="p-col">Established in the late 1960s, our family owned business is based in Edinburgh and Falkirk, but services customers across the UK. </p></b>

                <p>Our Edinburgh branch has the longest history as an audio retailer in the UK. During recent renovations, receipts were found from Nicolson’s Gramophone Saloon dating back to 1926. In the 1950s WG Graham took over the shop and renamed it WG Graham’s Hi-Fi Corner. Upon his retirement, Graham Tiso bought the business and shortened the name to Hi-Fi Corner.  

                    Soon thereafter a young enthusiastic Colin MacKenzie (left), who was recommended by Linn’s own Ivor Tiefenbrun, was employed to manage the shop; with a knack for business and years of experience in the hi-fi industry, Colin would later become the owner of Hi-Fi Corner. Today, Struan MacKenzie carries on the legacy as the company’s Managing Director.

                <p>Would you choose a quality car without a test drive? If you are familiar with the brand and have great trust in it, you might. However, our listening preferences are unique to the individual and with many of our customers new to the world of high quality sound and vision, we encourage everyone to come in to demonstrate the products they are interested in. You’ll find a relaxing and comfortable environment in both our Edinburgh and Falkirk premises where you can decide for yourself if the kit is right for you. We also offer home demonstrations on selected products.

                    It's our aim to get the right product for you.
                    
                    Our experts are on hand to guide you through the differences between speakers, amplifiers and sources and provide simple solutions that suit your needs.
